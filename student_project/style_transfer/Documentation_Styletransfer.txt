!!! IF LARGE DATASET (imagenet, paintings, ...) NOT IN FOLDER NAMED "DATA", THEN ADD THE FOLDER NAME TO THE .gitignore FILE!!!

1.) Get Tiny imagenet from:  https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/6127
2.) Get raw paintings for style from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers/data
3.) get style models vgg and decoder from download section here: https://github.com/naoto0804/pytorch-AdaIN/tree/master
4.) Get all the code for stylizing from: https://github.com/rgeirhos/Stylized-ImageNet/tree/master
5.) In script "general.py": Adjust paths for the models, the image dataset, the painting dataset and the output directory
6.) Scrip <Transform_Validation_Structure>: Transform Validation folder of Tiny Imagenet to the same format as Trainset: One folder per class, get classes from annotation-	file. Testset is useless, since no labels given


dataloader expects folder structure as follows:

-train
------labels1
	------img1.jpeg
	------img2.jpeg
	------ ....
------labels2
	.....
